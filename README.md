# Task 1  

Write a program which reads from the user three non-negative integers and then prints, using symbols ’*’, a ‘histogram’ of the data represented by the numbers, i.e., three vertical bars, aligned at the bottom, with heights equal to the values of the three numbers.  

For example, for numbers 3, 1 and 8 the result should look like this:  

```
  *
  *
  *

* *
***
```
  
Do not use arrays, strings or any other kind of collections.
